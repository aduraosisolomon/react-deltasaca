<blockquote>The Delta State Agency for the Control of HIV/AIDS (DELSACA), formerly known as State Action Committee on AIDS (SACA) officially came into being following the signing into law of the bill establishing the Agency, by the His Excellency, the Governor, Senator Dr. Arthur Ifeanyi Okowa on 25th July, 2017.
The Committee which transformed into an Agency was established in 2005 as an implementing arm of the World Bank HIV/AIDS Programme Development Project, with the sole responsibility of coordinating HIV/AIDS activities and all related matters thereof in line with the principle of the "three one" â€“ one coordinating body at the National/State level, one National/State Strategic Plan and, one Monitoring and Evaluation System at the National/State level. 
Activities of the Agency are spread in the 25 Local Governments of the State through other outlets such as LACAs, NGOs, FBOs, CSOs etc.
